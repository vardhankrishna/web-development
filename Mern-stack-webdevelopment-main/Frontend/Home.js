     <h3> Importance of Health Insurance </h3>
     <h5>
Buying a health insurance policy for yourself and your family is important because medical care is expensive, 
especially in the private sector. Hospitalisation can burn a hole in your pocket and derail your finances. 
It will become even tough, if the person who brings in the money, is now in a hospital bed. All this can be avoided by just paying a small annual premium
 which would lessen your stress in case of medical emergencies. A good health insurance policy would usually cover expenses made towards doctor consultation fees,
  costs towards medical tests, ambulance charges, hospitalization costs and even post-hospitalization recovery costs to a certain extent.
